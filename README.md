# Advent-of-Code-2018 in Swift Playgrounds

I saw the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/) on Twitter and thought it would be fun to give it a try. Since my day to day work is spent in Swift, I decided to solve each puzzle in a Swift Playground. This does bring in some strangeness, but I've been spending more time in Playgrounds now and it is a simple way to tweak your code and see the results in real time.

Enjoy
